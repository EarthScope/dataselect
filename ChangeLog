2024.165: v4.0.1
	- Retain miniSEED v2 sequence numbers when re-packing records during pruning.

2024.148: v4.0.0
	A new major version that supports both miniSEED v2 and v3.
	This release also removes many of the more esoteric features of the
	program in order make it more maintainable.

	- Port to libmseed 3.1.2 with support for both miniSEED v2 and v3.
	- The modification log now includes SourceIDs instead of Net,Sta,Loc,Chan.
	- Byte range annotation on input file names now uses a "-" between start
	and end offsets to match libmseed.  Legacy delimiter ":" also supported.
	- Allow -Q to accept publication versions in addition to RDQM codes.
	- Add -m option to match source ID against globbing pattern.
	- Add -snd to skip non-miniSEED data, otherwise quit on unrecognized input.
	- Add -VCHAN archive layout option that uses publication version.
	- Allow -Q to accept publication versions in addition to RDQM codes.
	- Remove skipping of channels on decoding errors, output untrimmed record.
	- Remove the -szs (skip-zero-sample records) option.
	- Remove the -lso (longest segment only) option.
	- Remove the -msl (minimum segment length) option.
	- Remove the -sb (staging buffer) option.
	- Remove capability to replace input files and the -rep and -nb options.
	- Remove -R (source ID rejection) option.
	- Remove match/reject list file capability.
	- Remove -sum (basic summary) option.
	- Remove -S[dhm] (split boundary) option.
	- Remove -rls (split on record length change) option.
	- Remove -mod (modification summary) option.
	- Remove warning about LIBMSEED_LEAPSECOND_FILE, now included in libmseed.

2023.054: 3.24
	- Fix heap corruption fault due to free'ing just-allocated archive
	file entry.
	- Avoid needelessly closing open files when seeking to remain under
	open file limit.

2023.009: 3.23
	- Update libmseed to 2.19.8.
	- Properly handle larger file sizes.

2019.185: 3.22
	- Update libmseed to 2.19.6
	- Treat archiving writing failures as fatal errors.

2017.283: 3.21
	- Update libmseed to 2.19.5, with fix for leap second calculation.

2017.270: 3.20
	- Add test and warning for impossible combination of selections
	applied to a single record and avoid any pruning operation.
	Specifically, two or more selections may specify two or more different
	time ranges within the same record.  The program does not support this
	as it is limited to trimming a single record to a single time range.

2017.251: 3.20rc
	- Update libmseed to 2.19.4.
	- Reorganize miniSEED output writer such that re-packed records that
	result in two or more records are properly included in the output.
	- Add preset -SDS archive layout, patch from @bonaime, thanks!

2016.302: 3.19
	- Update libmseed to 2.18.
	- Read any leap second list file indicated by the LIBMSEED_LEAPSECOND_FILE
	environment variable and use it when determining data coverage.
	- Fix edge case of pruning data and splitting on time boundaries when
	resulting record only contains a single sample.
	- Reformat source according to included clang-format profile.
	- Remove Makefile.wat, src/Makefile.wat and src/Makefile.win.  This
	will not build in Windows without a replacement for system regex.

2016.179: 3.18
	- Update libmseed to 2.17.
	- Add error check in trimrecord() for errors returned by msr_pack().
	- Add Warning in trimrecord() when data are repacked into more than
	one record, data loss is certain.  There is no easy work around in
	dataselect to output more than one record at this point, hopefully
	this is rare.

2015.050: 3.17
	- Each input file may be specified with a byte range to read. Useful
	to limit dataselect's operation to specific parts of files.

2015.030: 3.16
	- Optimize dealing with duplication when pruning traces by changing
	findcoverage() to skip trace entries that are already represented
	in the coverage.
	- Optimize search for coverage in trimtrace() by avoiding multiple
	checks on records that have already been removed.  This also fixes
	a mis-count of removed records.

2014.268: 3.15
	- Fix loop logic in minsegmentlength() causing segmentation faults.

2014.258: 3.14
	- Update libmseed to 2.13.
	- New -outprefix argument to add a prefix to each output record
	summary line.  Helpful when identifying the potentially mixed output.
	- Allow '-out --' for sending the output summary to stderr.
	- Clean up Makefile and src/Makefile, remove gcc specifics and tidy.

2013.329:
	- Free memory of pruned structures to avoid (mostly inconsequential)
	memory leaks, best to be clean about this kind of thing (I suppose).
	- Remember why "write lists" are created and add comments so I stop
	wondering why.  Hint: it is so the record entries can be sorted
	together even when they come from different segments/qualities.

2013.280: 3.13
	- Do not time sort records when only pruning the start/end times (-Pe).
	The records have already been sorted by time within a segment and if
	overlap is contained in the data we do not want the records re-sorted.

2013.274: 3.12
	- Update libmseed to 2.12, including a fix for reconstructing a time
	series when a positive leap second is noted in the activity flags of
	the fixed section data header.

2013.056: 3.11
	- Update libmseed to 2.10, including more time string parsing and more
	checks for bad data potentially causing a segmentation fault.
	The bad data check results in the remainder of the channel being skipped.

2012.356: 3.10
	- Set time correction applied flag when repacking records with previously
	unapplied time corrections.
	- Fix missing samples when splitting on day, hour, minute.  Thanks to
	Peix Fabrice for reporting the issue.

2012.257: 3.9
	- Update libmseed to 2.7.
	- Add -Pe option to request pruning at edges only (user specified start
	and end) at the sample level.  This will leave overlap within the user
	specified time window but will trim traces to the window.

2012.135:
	- Fix error message when skipping unsupported encodings or ASCII.

2012.056: 3.8
	- Fix crash when minimum-segment-length eliminates all traces and leaves
	an empty record structure.  Note MSL is tested on quality-specific traces.

2011.363: 3.7
	- Detect trimming of all samples from a record and skip gracefully (do
	not report an error), this can legitimately happen when a selected time
	range is shorter than sample period and no sample exists in the range.
	- Fix usage of staging buffer (-sb option) when pruning to sample level.

2011.362:
	- Fix splitting of records on boundaries where the sample is exactly on
	the boundary.  Thanks to Jean-Baptiste Le Blanc for reporting.

2011.349:
	- Update to libmseed 2.6.2.

2011.332:
	- Fix parsing of match/rejection list files, the error only occurred
	with multiple lines on systems with specific snprintf() behavior.

2011.287: coprocessor day
	- Optimize search for overlapping traces in findcoverage() by ending
	search of a segment list after getting to segments that start after
	the end time of the target, possible because the list is time ordered.

2011.242: 3.6
	- Modify contents of -out file to include quality code and sample count
	and to use vertical bars to separate fields.

2011.231:
	- Add -out option to write a summary of output records to a file.
	- Skip trimming ASCII encoded data records.
	- Fix pruning at corner case of selection matching only first or last
	sample in a record.

	- Fix pruning in cases involving the global start and end times.

2011.144: 3.5.1
	- Update to libmseed 2.6.1 with fixes for more graceful handling of bad
	data and corner-case IRIS archive files.

2011.033: 3.5rc2
	- Update to libmseed 2.6rc2.

2011.014: 3.5rc1
	- Add -sb option to specify the size of a staging buffer that will
	be used to store records to avoid re-reading them for output.

2011.007:
	- Update libmseed to 2.6rc1.

2010.170: 3.4
	- Add +o option to append to output file instead of overwriting.

2010.149: 3.3
	- Skip trimming of records when encoding/packing is not supported.
	- Add -szs option to skip records containing zero sample count.

2010.104: 3.2
	- Change integer suffixes added to file names with the -rls option
	to do zero padding up to 6 digits to facilitate file name sorting.

2010.071: 3.1
	- Add -rls option to split output files on record length changes by
	adding integer suffixes to the file names.

2010.068: 3.0
	- Update libmseed to 2.5.1.
	- Allow selection file to be "-" to read selection lines from stdin.

2010.064:
	- Time sort output record list when data has been pruned.
	- Prune full records when the selected data is duplicated when pruning
	at the sample level in addition to the record level.

2010.055:
	- Fix determination of strictest end time when pruning at sample level.
	- Prune full records when the selected data is duplicated when pruning
	at the record level.
	- Use HPTERROR as NULL value for newstart and newend to avoid problems
	with start/end times at 1970,1,0:0:0 (i.e. hptime == 0).

2010.052:
	- Add memory allocation tests to better handle out of memory errors.

2010.047:
	- Update libmseed to 2.5 with a fix for sorting out of time order
	MSTraceSeg entries (triggered by out of order records).

2010.026:
	- When unpacking errors occur during writing to the output files skip
	to the next channel and emit an ERROR message to help identify the
	channel.

2010.025:
	- Fix handling of overlapping selection entries by finding all matching
	selection entries and calculating maximum extents.
	- Make msr_unpack() errors for archive writing fatal errors.
	- Continue after unpacking errors during trimrecord(), include
	untrimable record in output.

2010.015:
	- Update libmseed to 2.4.
	- Add -m option to add a srcname to the selection list, this option
	is effectively a globbing version of -M (which does regex matching).

2010.010:
	- readtraces(): do not recalculate record starttime and only generate
	ASCII time string when needed for printing as small optimizations.
	- Fix cleanup calls to use ms_readmsr_main().

2010.007:
	- Update to libmseed 2.4dev3.
	- Use ms_readmsr_main() and pass the selections list pointer which
	will be used to skip sections in packed files (DMC use).
	- Use the new Selections facility in libmseed and remove the selection
	file routines, functionality should be identical.

	- Update to libmseed 2.2rc3 and convert trace management to the
	new MSTraceList, MSTraceID, MSTraceSeg functionality.
	- Add -s option to specify arbitrary data selection criteria,
	time windows specified using this option will be used as strict
	boundaries when pruning at the sample level.
	- Add file list capability, files specified on the command line
	starting with '@' are files containing a list of input files.
	- Remove POD structure processing and related special cases.
	- Fix pruning of single sample overlaps when overlap is within
